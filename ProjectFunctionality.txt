Project Summary: Jambo Travel Bot
Inspiration The idea for the Jambo Travel Bot was born out of a passion for artificial
intelligence, nurtured during a computer science degree. The decision to create a
customer-facing travel AI agent bot that assists with flight bookings was influenced by the
practicality and modern-world applicability of such a tool.
Functionality The bot serves as a flight booking agent, it integrates with the Amadeus API
using Open API specifications and cloud functions. The process involves three steps:
1. Searching for flights using the Amadeus Flight Offers Search API, which returns the
cheapest flights for a given itinerary.
2. Confirming the availability and final price (including taxes and fees) of flights returned by
the Flight Offers Price API. This step also provides pricing for ancillary products like
additional bags or extra-legroom seats and details on the payment information required
to complete the booking.
3. Creating a flight order using the Flight Create Orders API, which performs the final
booking for a chosen flight and provides a unique booking ID and reservation details
once the reservation is completed.
The project functionality can be summarized as follows
1. Recieve a request from the traveler through the google vertex AI platform
2. Call acloud function which runs the Amadeus API logic
3. Return the results of the cloud function
Construction The Jambo Travel Bot operates entirely on REST APIs and the Google Cloud
Platform. It was built using the Google Vertex AI Agent Builder, Google Cloud Functions and
Cloud Run, Amadeus Self Service Test APIs, and Google Cloud Storage Bucket. The bot takes
input from the traveler through a prompt, builds a request body using Swagger 3.0 Open API
specifications, sends this request by triggering the respective cloud function, and returns the
response to the user. In certain cases, the project stores JSON data in a Google Cloud Storage
Bucket and downloads it for use when calling the Amadeus API.
Challenges The project faced several challenges, including lengthy debugging periods,
difficulties in passing parameters from one agent to another, and correcting incorrect responses.
Achievements The integration of the Amadeus Flight Search and Flight Offers Price API to the
Google Vertex AI agent using cloud functions and Open API Swagger 3.0 specifications is a
significant accomplishment.
Learnings The project provided valuable experience in creating an agent and giving it prompts
on Google Vertex AI Agent Builder, using examples to train the agent with input and output
summaries, using an Open API specification tool to send requests from the Vertex AI agent to
Google Cloud Functions, executing the Amadeus API from a cloud function and returning theresponse in the Vertex AI agent, storing output from API calls in Google Cloud Storage Buckets,
and accessing the data in the GCS bucket from the cloud function for use when calling an API.
Future Plans The goal for Jambo Travel is to evolve into a full travel assistant that can search
for flights, confirm flight offers, create a flight order, help users find the perfect stay at over
150,000 hotels worldwide, provide transportation services, and create a modern user interface
where more functionality can be added, such as seat map display and chat agent integration.
