# Test Case: Google Vertex AI  Flight Booking Agent Full Flow

## Test Case ID: 001

## Description:
This test case verifies that the Google Vertex AI agent correctly retrieves and returns information from the Amadeus API when deployed in a Cloud Function.

## Pre-requisites:
1. Google Vertex AI agent is properly set up and configured.
2. Cloud Function is deployed and linked to the Vertex AI agent.
3. Amadeus API is accessible and the API key is valid.

## Test Steps:
1. Greet the user , and determine their intent
2.If the user wants to travel , redirect them to the flight search agent
3. In the flight search agent , determine the following
    - the travelers origin location
    - the travelers destination location
    - the date and time of travelling
    - traveller information i.e how many travellers are included and if any otf them are children
4.perform the flight search operation by calling the getFlightOffers tool
  - This tool executes a clous function using the request body collected above as a json input parameter
  - it returns the results of the getflightoffers
  - it displays the results to the users
  - if no other questtions are posed it terminates

5. Route the user to the Confirm Flight offer agent
    - Ask the user if he / she wants to see more flight information
    - download thye flight offers from a google cloud bucket and use this values as input when calling the flight offers price APi
    -Return this flight information in a user firendly way



## Expected Result:
- The flight search agennt should return flight offers and provide information on the flight offers data from the amadeus API using the deifned getflightoffers cloud function
- The confirm flight offers agent should download the flight details from the google cloud storage bucket and use the downloaded data to call the amadeus APi using the defined flightoffersprice cloud function
- The travel steering agent should route the traveler between the two agents

## Actual Result:
- The flight search agent indeed returns the flight offers and successfully calls the amadeus API
- The confirm flight offer successfully downloads the data ,and uses it to call the amadeus API
    - The function sometimes returns the input as it is returned from the tool and does not summarise it in human readable form unless told
    -The function soemtimes fails to send the downlaoded data from google cloud storage bucket , returning an error , normally trying again fixes the issue .

## Status (Pass/Fail):
- Flight search agent calls amadeus API using cloud function and returns Status cose 200
- Confirm flight offer price returns the extra flight information and returns status code 200
- On the rare occcasion when the confirm flight offer price does not work it returns error 400 status code

## Notes:
- The create flight order agent is not included in this submission due to errors , however in the coming days it will be added.
- The plan is to iteratively progress and improve the Jambo Travel Bot
